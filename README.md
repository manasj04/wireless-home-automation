# Wireless Home Automation
DTMF Decoder based Wireless Home Automation Device

**What this project is about ?**

Home automation covers all the aspects of centralized control of lighting, HVAC (heating, ventilation and air conditioning), 
home appliances, security locks of windows and doors.  Wireless home automation provides better facilities and increased quality 
of life for the elderly and disabled who might otherwise require specialised care and be left to fend off for themselves.

With the use of this mobile controlled home automation using Arduino, you can perform switching operation of any load or device 
which is connected with the given circuit. Suppose you are away from home or office and you forgot to switch off any load like tube 
light, fan or air conditioner. Now one way is that to switch it off is to go back wasting your time and vehicle's fuel to turn it off.
But if you have installed this wireless home automation system in your office or home, you can switch off that device 
right from your current location. 

**Key Aspects of this Project are :**

**1.** C/C++ Programming in Arduino IDE

**2.** Arduino Uno

**3.** DTMF Decoder

**4.** Integrated Electronics

**5.** Smart Phone.
